# Codes to reproduce some of the results of Viens and Denolle (Submitted to BSSA)

- The Matlab codes in the "Codes" folder reproduce the waveforms for the NAGH and KNHH stations presented in Figure 8 as well as Figures 4a and 4c. <br/>
- The Large_earthquake_simulation.m code simulates the 2004 Mw 7.2 Off the Kii peninsula earthquake. The code produces three plots: <br/>
  1) The comparison between the simulated and observed waveforms. <br/>
  2) The amplitude of the moment rate functions over the fault plane as well as the total moment rate function. <br/>
  3) The comparison between the observed and simulated response spectra. <br/>
  
  
- The Python codes to compute impulse response functions (IRFs) are available at: https://github.com/lviens/2017_GJI <br/>
